# MATLAB Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains MATLAB code solutions for two machine learning problems:

## Problem 1: k-Nearest Neighbor Method

In this problem, we utilize the k-nearest neighbor method to estimate class conditional density functions and perform classification tasks.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Estimate class conditional density functions using k-nearest neighbor method.
2. Plot the results using the mesh function in MATLAB.
3. Classify a specific vector (x = [1, -2]^T) based on the density estimation with k = 10.

## Problem 2: Data Visualization and Batch Perceptron Method

This problem involves data visualization and applying the Batch Perceptron method for linear discriminant function.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Plot the 2-D dataset to visualize the samples.
2. Assume a projection function (j) and plot augmented vectors in 3-D using the plot3 function.
3. Use the Batch Perceptron method to find the weight vector in the generalized linear discriminant function.
